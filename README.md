# AI Projects Collection  
### Face Mask Detection + Sign Language Recognition (2-in-1 Submission Repository)

This repository contains **two complete AI projects**, each built with modern Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and UI technologies.

Both projects are production-ready, well-structured, and designed for academic or professional submission.

---

# Projects Included

## 1. Face Mask Detection with Live Alert System

A real-time face mask detection system using **TensorFlow/Keras**, **OpenCV**, **Flask**, and **Pygame**.  
It detects whether a person is wearing a mask and triggers an **audio alert** for “No Mask”.  
Includes a **full Flask UI** with camera control.

### Key Features
- Real-time mask detection via webcam  
- CNN model trained on Kaggle dataset  
- Audio alert for “No Mask”  
- Flask UI with Start/Stop camera  
- Responsive CSS UI  
- Clean project architecture

## 2. Real-Time Sign Language Recognition (MobileNet + MediaPipe)

A gesture-based real-time sign recognition system using **MediaPipe**, **ROI-based dataset generation**, **MobileNet CNN**, and **Streamlit UI**.

### Key Features
- ROI extraction for dataset  
- Real-time hand tracking  
- MobileNet CNN classifier  
- Streamlit cinematic UI  
- Text-to-speech output 
- Open palm = space gesture  
- Auto-deletes RAW frames
